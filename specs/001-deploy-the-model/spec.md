# Feature Specification: Deploy Disaster Tweet Classification Model

**Feature Branch**: `[001-deploy-the-model]`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Complete
**Input**: User description: "Deploy the model using X API v2 ‚Üí Data Collector ‚Üí Preprocessing ‚Üí Model Inference ‚Üí Streamlit UI"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Description: "Deploy the model using X API v2 ‚Üí Data Collector ‚Üí Preprocessing ‚Üí Model Inference ‚Üí Streamlit UI"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: X API v2, Data Collector, Preprocessing, Model Inference, Streamlit UI
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Define the deployment pipeline flow and user interaction
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

### ML Project Specific Considerations
For disaster tweet classification and similar ML projects:
- **Model Performance**: Specify accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score requirements
- **Latency Requirements**: Real-time processing needs (<1s response time)
- **Data Sources**: Specify tweet sources, API limits, authentication methods
- **Feature Engineering**: Define which features to extract and maintain consistency
- **Model Deployment**: Single-file vs. microservice deployment approach

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a disaster response coordinator, I need to deploy a classification system that can automatically identify disaster-related tweets from X (Twitter) API data, process and classify them in real-time, and provide an intuitive interface for monitoring and analysis, so that I can quickly identify emerging disaster situations and respond appropriately.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a deployed model system, **When** the X API v2 provides new tweet data, **Then** the system must automatically collect, process, and classify the tweets
2. **Given** classified disaster tweets, **When** a user accesses the Streamlit UI, **Then** they must be able to view the classification results and relevant tweet information
3. **Given** the system is running, **When** real-time tweets are processed, **Then** classification results must be available in the UI within 1 second
4. **Given** the preprocessing pipeline, **When** raw tweet data is received, **Then** it must be cleaned and formatted consistently with training data
5. **Given** the deployed model, **When** preprocessed data is provided, **Then** it must generate accurate classification predictions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the X API v2 rate limit is reached?
- How does the system handle tweets in languages other than English?
- What happens when the model encounters ambiguous or unclear tweet content?
- How does the system handle API authentication failures or network interruptions?
- What occurs when the preprocessing pipeline encounters malformed or incomplete tweet data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST collect real-time tweet data from X API v2 using recent tweet search with disaster-related keywords
- **FR-002**: System MUST process collected tweets through a preprocessing pipeline that cleans and standardizes text data
- **FR-003**: System MUST classify processed tweets using the trained disaster classification model with target accuracy > 75%
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a web-based user interface through Streamlit for monitoring classification results
- **FR-005**: System MUST display classification results in real-time showing confidence scores and disaster categories
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle API rate limiting and authentication for X API v2
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain data consistency between collection, preprocessing, and classification stages
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide error handling and recovery mechanisms for failed API requests or processing failures

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Tweet Data**: Individual tweet objects containing text content, metadata, timestamps, and user information
- **Classification Result**: Output from the model indicating disaster classification confidence and category
- **Processing Pipeline**: Series of data transformation steps that prepare raw tweets for model inference
- **User Interface**: Web-based dashboard for monitoring and interacting with classification results
